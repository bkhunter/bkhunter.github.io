	      I’m originally from the serene Salt Spring Island, a small community off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Post secondary school, I attended the University of Alberta for a biology degree with the intention of pursuing medicine. However, this career would be no more than a placeholder for me, evidenced by my lackluster performances in biology classes and the broad range of courses I took in my first two years: Latin, History, Psychology, Geology, Philosophy, etc. I continued exploring until I took an introductory Computing course and loved it; it was the first course I had taken at University where I was excited to do assignments, and delved deeper into the material on my own. I decided that even though I wasn’t sure where I would fit in, Computing was a field where I could fit in, and made for a practical choice.

	    <p>
	      Three years later, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science with specialization in Computing Science with Distinction and also completed a certificate in computer game development. I have a broad skill set in the discipline including programming, agile development, networks, databases, web applications, video game development, 3D animation and graphics, algorithms, and more. After I graduated, I was employed for eight months by the University’s software engineering department to help develop an exercise game for seniors and have now returned to British Columbia to continue in the field of Computing Science.

	    <p>During my degree I realized that one of the most exciting applications of computing for me is video games. The possibility that someone could explore something I imagined or dreamt about, to the extent that it provokes emotion or enjoyment, is something I find to be incredibly beautiful. I also consider game development to be a field which draws upon many different elements, and favours people with a broad skillset - a skillset that I have. As luck would have it, the University of Alberta has a certificate program that involves taking courses either specifically about making games, or containing skills that transfer to game development.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I jumped at the chance to enrol in this program and because of it took courses on 3D graphics and animation, advanced games programming, understanding video games, video games in an educational context, and created two large scale games in teams with other programmers, artists, musicians, and writers. I hope there is a place for me in the games industry, but if not I know that because I have the tools to create and develop content on my own, creating video games will remain part of my life regardless of my employment.

		<p>Growing up, I had two major passions: sports and music. I’m a self taught guitar player and I’ve played the drums since I was four years old, both as a percussionist in my community concert band and a drummer here and there. I played soccer casually since elementary school and developed an intense interest in Basketball when I was in high school.Today I still enjoy these activities but only as a hobby. These days I like to play games such as Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, solve puzzles, code up ideas or games, make jokes, and drink tea.

		<p>
		  Something I’ve come to understand about myself is that I love developing skills and seeing myself improve; a core part of sports, music, and computing science. For this reason, my favourite thing is learning new information that inspires me, makes me think in a different way, or develops what I already know. I hope you have enjoyed this cursory glance into my life, and if you would like to talk or work together feel free to <a href="contact.html" style="color:blue">contact me.</p>
