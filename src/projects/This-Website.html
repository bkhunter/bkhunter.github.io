	      <p>With newfound free time, I decided developing a personal website would be a rewarding and fun project. I had made webpages before, but never really had time to explore HTML, CSS, or Javascript and was eager to start experimenting. My goals of the website were fairly simple: Let visitors read about who I am, gain insight into my projects and experiences, look over my resume, and most importantly contact me should they like what they see. The website is inspired by many sources such as the personal webpages of my colleagues, bootstrap templates, the websites of professional developers, and various sites that caught my eye. It’s finalized now, but is very much a living project that will continue to be updated as I learn and grow in industry. What it will look like at the end of my career I cannot say, but should be interesting to see.

	    <div class="project-text">
	      <p>The design of this website has been an incremental process, drawing from many sources all over the web. For example, the above colours represent the colour scheme of the website, which I took from this picture of the pokemon Blastoise (my generation 1 starter of choice).<img class="img-responsive" height="200" width="400"style="padding:15px;"align="right" src="../../Images/projectImages/Blastoise.png" alt="User Profile"> The project tiles were based on the tiles in the new tab screen on my firefox browser, and the main page style came from a mix of templates from <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/" style="color:blue">Start Bootstrap</a>, and an image from <a href="http://gratisography.com/" style="color:blue">gratisography</a>. These are the main inspirations, but many other small details came from all over the web, which really helped the design process. This website is static, meaning it contains no database design and doesn’t change based on user input or anything else. I do have experience making dynamic websites, but my goals for this website didn’t require it, so the entire project is made with just HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
	      </p>

	      <p>My personal website has undergone two versions since I began working on it. Version one was similar in functionality but had differences in navigation, projects interface, and also had some javascript animations (which were highly unnecessary). I put it out, and got some less than positive feedback from my peers, such as it was too dark, cluttered, unprofessional, clumsy, and my favourite, it looked like a 90’s website. Below are some screenshots of this version. Another issue with version one, my unecessary custom javascript animations made responsiveness very inconsistent. Sometimes text would overlap, images would be disproportionate or completely hidden, and there was a general risk the site wouldn’t work. Many hard-coded solutions and custom media queries partially solved the problem, but with all the screen types and sizes in the world the chances that the website would look really bad to someone was quite high. So with the constructive criticism in mind, I started from scratch.</p>

	      <div class="row" style="padding:10px 0px 20px 0px;">
		<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
		   <img class="img-responsive" src="../../Images/projectImages/OldWebsiteMain.png" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Old Main Page">
		</div>
		
		<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
		  <img class="img-responsive" src="../../Images/projectImages/OldWebsiteProjects.png" alt="Old Projects Page">
		</div>
	      </div>
		 

	      <p>Version two has no javascript, not because I have anything against it, but more because I really wanted to focus on simplicity and cut back on unnecessary components. I also developed it with responsiveness in mind, which meant checking different resolutions along the way, not after everything is finished for one screen size. It’s been an interesting experience, making this website, one that I’ve learned a lot from but was more work than I intended. While I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism, I like how the site is now and I think I will leave it be for some time. I hope that you, the reader, have enjoyed peering into my life and looking through these projects, and that using the website has been a pleasant experience.
