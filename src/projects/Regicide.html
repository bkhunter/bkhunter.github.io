	      <p>Regicide is a text adventure made with Pygame for the University of Alberta course ‘Understanding Video Games’, another in the game development certificate. The design required the theme of chess, so we based our characters on its built-in classes (pawn, knight, etc.) and had them move around a 2D environment (pictured below) accordingly. The player plays as an assassin mysteriously hired to kill the king of the kingdom, and has the ability to move around the game according to what disguise they are wearing. For example, if the player kills a peasant (based on a pawn), they may decide to 'steal their identity', granting the ability to move around as a pawn would, and gaining access to areas a peasant could enter. This mechanic allowed us to introduce puzzle and story elements to the game such as requiring the player to become a certain class in order to move to a certain area, and adding the risk of revealing themselves, should the player enter areas or talk to npcs as the wrong class. The overall goal of Regicide is to progress through the castle, learn about your mysterious employment, make it to the king, and decide how the game should end.

	    <div>
	      <p>If you’re not familiar with the concept, a text-adventure is an old style of game/narrative where the story unfolds as the player enters commands into a console (our console is pictured above). This was the premise of our assignment, but we decided to augment our game with a mini-map and cutscenes; necessary as the chess incorporations we wanted were heavily reliant on 2d locations (like a chess board) and simply didn’t work in a pure text format. The cutscenes weren’t necessary, but we had a talented artist on our team (who drew all the art you see) and we wanted to use her as much as possible. These changes made the mechanics work, and the game complete, but took away from the pure text adventure style and simplicity. Pygame was an average choice for this project, as we weren’t constrained like other groups, but our artist and writer really couldn’t contribute to the actual game development. My contribution was mainly in programming the game, and writing story.

	    <p>
	      To my surprise, developing Regicide turned out to be more difficult than other games, even though it was only a text adventure. It showed me not only how important, but also how difficult it is to come up with a fundamentally sound game; a text adventure is so exposed that if your idea isn’t great, it shows. In our modern age, we have many technological tools that afford simple conveyance of information and ease the design process; tools that are great but can support a game which would otherwise be bad. I think the foundation of a game, like its story or mechanics, will always be difficult, but when done well will be fun regardless of format. Not that I’m not happy with our game, I think it is fun and original, but I feel like going beyond a pure text adventure was almost a cop-out, and I didn’t learn as much as I could have because of it. Below is a demo video of the beginning of Regicide, and you can read the design document <a href="../../files/RegicideDesignDoc.pdf" style="color:blue;">here</a>.
