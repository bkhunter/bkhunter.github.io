	      <p>At the University of Alberta, the last step in completing the Computer Game Development Certificate program is to take INTD 450, an interdisciplinary game development course. The idea is that students in the program have been taking specialized courses (i.e. writing in games, programming for games, etc.) and can now consolidate their knowledge by applying it to a large project. Keith to the Past was one such project. The inspiration behind this game is somewhat interesting, we were meant to have a sixth member, Keith, who missed the first two classes- and dropped the course before we could meet him. During our initial group meetings, we would joke “I miss Keith”, or “has anyone seen keith yet”, and most importantly “we should make a game about looking for Keith”. If you know anything about me, you know that I love puns so once someone suggested Keith (keys) to the Past, and “the five stages of Keith” I was in.</p> <p>

The game is about an unnamed protagonist who is looking for Keith, someone close to her who is missing. Story is delivered through dialogue between an omniscient-like narrator and the protagonist as she she travels through her own memories in a metaphorical time machine. The primary mechanic of the game is that at each stage of grief this “time machine” breaks down and the player must fix it by collecting crystals, which appear randomly around the map. Each level contains enemies that the player must adapt to while collecting these crystals. When held, a crystal slows down the player making it more difficult to escape enemies. The player may also choose to drop crystals and increase their speed, which adds a risk-reward element. The final product is a semi-serious foray into dealing with grief and working towards acceptance.

	      <p>The ideal team composition for the course is a writer, a musician, an artist, and three programmers. Unfortunately, class enrollment was mostly programmers and our team ended up being very computing science oriented. We were granted total autonomy in our process and tools; while my preference for game engine is Unity, the professor told us that it has never once worked for a team. With this in mind we elected to go with Pygame, a Python library for creating games, because of our collective knowledge and familiarity with Python. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t say pygame is an optimal choice - it allows a lot of control, but requires the implementation of every minutia. </p>
	      <p>
		My role in the group was as lead programmer, which in the beginning seemed almost redundant in a team of computing scientists, but ended with me writing most of the code. This was difficult because I felt a responsibility for the game to work, but there just wasn’t enough time to maintain quality standards. In terms of design, this project was very interesting as each level needed to somewhat convey the stage of grief it represented. Acceptance was more difficult to encapsulate than the others so we decided to have one of each type of enemy on a small map as a final test. Each level is intended to have some sort of symbolism in service of the higher theme and meaning of the game. The above images show a snapshot of each level, from top-left:
		<ul>
		  <li><p>Denial, grass and flowers on a nice day where the enemies only chase you if you get too close.</p></li>
		  <li><p>Anger, fiery and rocky with erratic and fast enemies.</p></li>
		  <li><p>bargaining, a mercantile map where you have to find coins and give them to enemies that run away from you.</p></li>
		  <li><p>depression, cold and somber with enemies that move towards you only when you move or hold crystals.</p></li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Overall I’m very happy with how this project turned out, but a few things prevented it from being great. I’ve spoken to the difficult team composition but more specifically, the team lacked an artist and as a result made it very difficult for our game to claim any sort of distinct style. Most of the assets used were not custom and our sprites were not always appropriate. Due to having complete control over process and implementation, it became difficult to estimate how long things would take, and in the end forced us to cut interesting, but unessential parts of the game. I think in a course like this the journey is more important than the destination, and while I’m very proud of Keith to the Past, I believe the process of designing, developing, and collaborating on it is the real takeaway.
