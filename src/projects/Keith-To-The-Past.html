	      <p>Keith to the Past was a game developed in Python with Pygame and created for INTD 450, the capstone course in the University of Alberta’s Game Development Certificate. Keith to the Past is essentially about the grieving process, dealing with loss, and the pain and difficulty that can arise as a result. The story is told through dialogue between an omniscient-like narrator and an unnamed protagonist while she travels through her own memories in a metaphorical time machine. As she travels, the time machine breaks down and in order to restore it and continue her journey she must collect crystals which are spread throughout the level and randomly appear and disappear (shards of space-time? we didn’t really know). As the player attempts to collect crystals, they must avoid enemies who act differently depending on the level. Each level represents one of the five classic stages of grief, and overall the goal of the game is to find acceptance.

	      <p> Development of this game was very different when compared to my other experiences (see Cache_22) as we were granted total autonomy in our process and tools. While the freedom was refreshing, it brought new challenges such as independently determining feasibility and working without knowing whether the choices made were optimal, or even correct at all. In terms of design, this was a very interesting project as each level and its enemies needed to accurately convey the stage of grief it represented. My main role was as a programmer which meant I got to implement the game mechanics. I really came to enjoy this because, for this game, it actually gave me a lot of control over deciding what might make thematic sense for each level. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the main inspiration for the game’s story was the fact that we were meant to have a sixth member, Keith, who dropped the class before any of us could meet him. All we knew was that Keith was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.</br></br>

	I’m very happy with how this project turned out, but a few things prevented it from being a stellar success. First, the team lacked an artist which made it very difficult for our game to claim any sort of distinct style; most of the assets used were not custom and our sprites were not always appropriate. Second, due to having complete control, it became difficult to estimate how long things would take, and in the end forced us to cut interesting, but unessential parts of the game. I think in a course like this the journey is more important than the destination, and while I’m very proud of Keith to the Past, I believe the process of designing, developing, and collaborating on it is the real takeaway.
