	    <p class="info">This project was developed with researchers at the University of Alberta and the University of Sapporo. The objective was to assist players in learning Tai Chi, a traditional Chinese martial art involving a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner. The hypothesis was that the slow/methodical movement of Tai Chi would help developmentally challenged children with physical, social, and cognitive development. A Microsoft Kinect was used to both record and analyze a persons movement, while the actual game was built with the Unity game engine. I especially enjoyed working with Unity, as it allowed us to introduce game-like features to keep the application engaging. It was a great experience to work on what is known in the industry as a ‘serious game’, a game that is entertaining but more importantly has potential to make an impact in the real world. This project was one of the more significant of my undergraduate degree and gave me the opportunity to gain experience with agile processes, game development, and real client interaction.</p>

	    <p id="keithText" class="info">Keith to the Past was a game developed in Python with Pygame and created for INTD 450, the capstone course in the University of Alberta’s Game Development Certificate. Keith to the Past is essentially about the grieving process, dealing with loss, and the pain and difficulty that can arise as a result. The story is told through dialogue between an omniscient-like narrator and an unnamed protagonist while she travels through her own memories in a metaphorical time machine. As she travels, the time machine breaks down and in order to restore it and continue her journey she must collect crystals which are spread throughout the level and randomly appear and disappear (shards of space-time? we didn’t really know). As the player attempts to collect crystals, they must avoid enemies who act differently depending on the level. Each level represents one of the five classic stages of grief, and overall the goal of the game is to find acceptance.<span class="text-link" style="color:blue;" onclick="showText('keithText','keithTextHidden');">...Read More</span>
	    
	    <p id="keithTextHidden" class="hidden">Development of this game was very different when compared to my other experiences (see Cache_22) as we were granted total autonomy in our process and tools. While the freedom was refreshing, it brought new challenges such as independently determining feasibility and working without knowing whether the choices made were optimal, or even correct at all. In terms of design, this was a very interesting project as each level and its enemies needed to accurately convey the stage of grief it represented. My main role was as a programmer which meant I got to implement the game mechanics. I really came to enjoy this because, for this game, it actually gave me a lot of control over deciding what might make thematic sense for each level. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the main inspiration for the game’s story was the fact that we were meant to have a sixth member, Keith, who dropped the class before any of us could meet him. All we knew was that Keith was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.

	I’m very happy with how this project turned out, but a few things prevented it from being a stellar success. First, the team lacked an artist which made it very difficult for our game to claim any sort of distinct style; most of the assets used were not custom and our sprites were not always appropriate. Second, due to having complete control, it became difficult to estimate how long things would take, and in the end forced us to cut interesting, but unessential parts of the game. I think in a course like this the journey is more important than the destination, and while I’m very proud of Keith to the Past, I believe the process of designing, developing, and collaborating on it is the real takeaway.</p>

	    <p class="info">The BlogFace is a social media style website made with Django, and was created as part of a group project for a web development course. This was an interesting project because groups were required to communicate with each other's services which necessitated the development of a RESTful api. My contribution to the project was mostly on the back end of the website which gave me first hand experience with the creation and testing of the API, as well as Django, PostgreSQL, and web hosting services. Interestingly, my group connected with the most groups throughout the class because our back end was one of the most stable. We believe this is because we ‘ate our own dog food’, meaning that our back end and front end were developed distinctly, which forced us to make calls to our own API as opposed to directly querying our database, and ensured the API functioned as required. I was very happy with this project, and I’m very grateful to have had the opportunity to build a dynamic and elastic website in a team setting.</p>

	    <p id="cacheText" class="info">There’s a course at the U of A called CMPUT 250 which is famous because it brings together students from all kinds of different disciplines to create a video game by modding the Bioware title Neverwinter Nights. CMPUT 250 also serves as the gateway course for the Computer Game Development Certificate offered at the university. While mods for Neverwinter Nights are typically fantasy role playing games, my team and I wanted to push the boundaries of what seemed possible in this course and created Cache_22, a story-based rhythm game with moral choice, set in the future. My role was initially as a programmer, but I was also elected the project’s lead designer and mostly focused on level and character design, story and dialogue, and external mechanics during development.<span class="text-link" style="color:blue;" onclick="showText('cacheText','cacheTextHidden');">...Read More</span> 

	    <p id="cacheTextHidden" class="hidden">What really made this project different for me was the interdisciplinary aspect. At the end of the course, after all the discussions, brainstorms, opinions, and arguments, it was clear that in a creative setting a team of people from diverse backgrounds is a huge asset. Cache_22 was a project that I ended up spending most of my spare time on (as I had spare time back then) because I really enjoyed working on it and felt a desire for it to be successful. I know some people are put off by the long hours and sometimes stressful environment that game development can bring, but this experience showed me that with the right mix of people, the end result is absolutely worth the time. Cache_22 won the award for Technical Achievement at the U of A CMPUT 250 Game Development Awards and was nominated for Excellence in Music/Audio.</p>

	    <p id="parisTextHidden" class="hidden">The project was unfortunately made difficult due to a team member who created one of the more unusual and frustrating group dynamics I’ve ever experienced. However, even though it was terrible at the time, I feel that the team rose to the occasion, and how I approach working with people and teams improved as a result. The really important lessons I took away from this experience came from dealing with this less than optimal work environment, and from the vast amount of time it took to make this thing. Make no mistake, creating this animated video was nothing short of an ordeal, and gave me the utmost respect for beautiful 3d models and animations, and their overworked creators. I really enjoyed the creative freedom this course allowed, and intend on continuing to work with 3d animation even if only as a hobbyist. Feel free to watch the video, but just remember to keep an open mind.</p>

Our bot was fairly defensive as its main win condition was to survive until it could produce the late stage ‘High Templar’ and grant them a powerful ‘Psionic Storm’ attack. The hope was that once we could use this attack combined with well designed micro management we would overpower the opponent. The bot showed some success when tested but unfortunately performed quite poorly in the end tournament. Win or lose, this project offered great experience making AI for a complex game, and gave me insight into the difficulties that can come with familiarizing oneself with a new large code repository.</p>

	    <p id="regText" class="info">Regicide is a text adventure made in Python for the U of A course ‘Understanding Video Games’, another in the game development certificate. The design required the theme of chess, so we opted to base the characters on the built-in classes of chess and have them move around a 2d environment accordingly. The player plays as an assassin mysteriously paid to kill the king, and has the ability to move differently by killing different classes of civilians and taking their clothes. For example, if the player kills a peasant (based on a pawn), they may opt to 'steal their identity' and then move around as a peasant/pawn would. This mechanic allowed us to introduce puzzle and story elements to the game such as requiring the player to become a certain class in order to move to a certain area, and adding the risk of revealing themselves, should the player enter areas or talk to npcs as the wrong class. The overall goal is to progress through the castle, learn about your mysterious employment, make it to the king, and decide how the game should end.<span class="text-link" style="color:blue;" onclick="showText('regText','regTextHidden');">...Read More</span> 
	   
	    <p id="regTextHidden" class="hidden">Developing this game was more difficult than others because the genre of text adventure turned out to be fairly constraining. Many initial ideas were out of scope, or didn’t really seem feasible to do in plain text. This in fact was an obstacle we didn’t overcome; the chess incorporations we wanted were heavily reliant on 2d locations (like a chess board) and simply didn’t work in a pure text format. We ended up creating an accompanying mini map and also added cutscenes and images to help the game atmosphere. This made the mechanics work, but took away from the pure text adventure style. What I learned from this project  was that something seemingly simple like a text adventure can be very difficult to design with originality and be entertaining. I think a lot of game development tools afford simplicity and ease in the design process and conveyance of information, but that can sometimes support a game which would otherwise be bad. This project showed me that if the concept of a game is original and clever, however rare, the game will be fun regardless of format.</p>

	    <p id="edText" class="info">One of the available options for the computer game certificate at the University of Alberta is EDIT 486, a course in the Faculty of Education, centered around using games and interactive multimedia to teach. In this course you are required to develop two projects using game making tools designed for kids, the idea being that if you know what it’s like to use them, you know what you can expect in terms of learning and development from students. The first tool is Scratch, a drag and drop programming language developed at MIT, and the second is Kodu a 3D game development environment designed by Microsoft.<span class="text-link" style="color:blue;" onclick="showText('edText','edTextHidden');">...Read More</span> 
	   
	    <p id="edTextHidden" class="hidden">For my Scratch project I made a role playing game which used a very simple timing mechanic for battle, and followed a simple story. For kodu, I attempted to re-create Mario Party, with some success. These games were not meant to be large projects nor to be overly contrived in design, but instead were really about the process. Personally, in terms of game development experience, it was really just fun to try making games completely independently and see how far I could push these tools. On the other hand, in terms of education, learning how you can use tools like Scratch and Kodu to teach through building and sharing was completely novel to me, and frankly eye opening.</p>

	    <p class="info">Travel Planner was an android application designed to be a helpful tool for someone travelling on a budget. At its core is the ability to track travel expenses for the user, including purchases that could have attached receipts, locations, and data, and submit them to an approver for review. The project was part of a software engineering course and was managed by a mock manager in the lab TA and a mock client in the professor. Developing this project introduced me to several fundamental aspects of software engineering such as git and github, uml documentation, unit testing, and test driven development. While I appreciated how developmental this course was, the sheer amount required of the project affected the final result of the app. Some members of the team wanted to rapidly prototype, others wanted to only commit perfect code, and some were convinced documentation and testing was most important. A balance must exist, and this project brought me closer to finding it.</p>

	    <p class="info">This was a small fun project I did with a friend over a weekend to explore Python and Pygame. The challenge was to make a game with only audio as output and no visuals whatsoever. The initial idea was to simulate the experience of someone who fell into a pitch black cave and must now run from what sounds like a monster and escape. Soon after developing some base functionality we realized that a game like this would require some pretty interesting sounds/music, which we didn’t have access to or time to make. So we shifted towards a reactionary style game utilizing audio panning (how you distribute the sound between the left and right channels) where when you heard a certain sound, you had to press a certain key. The final game turned out to essentially be temple run with no visuals, but was surprisingly fun. This experience reinforced my opinion that when you constrain development, you realize just how difficult it can be create a unique and engaging game concept.</p>

	    <p class="info">My first web based project in my undergrad was making an Ocean Observation System using Php. This was part of a database management course and consisted of six modules: login, sensor and user management, upload, subscription, search, and data analysis. We worked in groups of three for this project, so it seemed natural to have each member complete two modules. I was assigned the sensor and user management and data analysis modules which was great because I still got to use standard database interactions (adding, updating, etc.) but also had to figure out more difficult, theoretical queries. I found it interesting that a database management course contained a substantial project which required the learning of html, css, and php, but given the nature of data on the web I’ve come to think it practical, and am thankful for the experience.</p>

With upcoming free time, I decided developing a website would both accomplish this goal, and be an interesting and fun experience. Another advantage of using this medium, is that as I learn and grow in industry I can both update the content of the site, as well as the design. What it will look like at the end of my career I cannot say, but should be interesting to see. I hope that you, the reader, have enjoyed peering into my life and looking through these projects, and that using the website has been a pleasant experience. This website is made with Bootstrap, Html, Css, a dash of custom Javascript, and hosted through github.</p>
