       <h2> About Me </h2>

       <div class="content">
	 <div class="well">
	   <h3>Hello! I’m Ben Hunter, and thank you for visiting my little corner of the web.</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>I’m a software developer who recently graduated with B.Sc. in computing science from the university of Alberta. I love to make software, design and create things, play music, and practically anything that allows me to be creative. </p>
	   </div>

	   <h3>Education</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>Although I really enjoy the tree of computing science and all of it’s branches, I didn’t always know it was for me. In fact, for the first two years of my undergraduate career I was enrolled in the general science program with a biology major and a chemistry minor (I had been watching a lot of "House" and thought medicine might be for me). However the classes I was taking were not indicative of a career in medicine: Latin, History, Psychology, Geology, Philosophy  and other extraneous courses were among my general science course-load. In my second semester of second year I took CMPUT 101 on a whim, and absolutely loved it; it was the first class I had taken where I actually wanted to explore the topics in my free time. While I didn’t know what exactly I wanted to do with a degree in computing, I knew it would be a good choice regardless of how I felt in the future. Fast forward  3 years and I have a broad skillset in the discipline including experience programming, developing software, networks, databases, web applications, game development, 3D animation and graphics, algorithms, and more. Alongside my degree I always received a certificate in computer game development.</p>

	   <h3>Speaking of Video Games...</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>One of the most exciting applications of computing for me is video games. The idea that something I imagine or dream about could be put into an interactive format for somebody else to enjoy, or to provoke emotion, I just find so beautiful. I think I’m so drawn to games because I think of games as the accumulation of many different skills, ideas, and experiences, and I feel that matches my strengths; I’m interested in a lot of different things and prefer a broad skillset to a singular specialty.  As mentioned above, I graduated with a certificate in computer game development, which enabled me to take game focused courses and gave me the the opportunity to create several games with teams during my degree. I’m still not sure what the future has in store for me, but I intend on ensuring games are in it, even if it means as a hobby. The dream is to one day get paid for it.</p>

	   <h3>Other stuff</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>I’m originally from the beautiful Salt Spring Island, B.C. When I’m not at a computer, you’ll find me shooting hoops, writing down bad jokes or puns,  playing music, or cracking wise. I love fantasy, especially Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, and recently have developed a fascination with outer space and astronomy. My favourite thing in the world is learning new information that inspires me, or makes me think about something in a different way...or laugh. If you have read this far, I commend you for your persistence, and thank you again for the interest.</p>
