       <h2> About Me </h2>

       <div class="content">
	 <div class="well">
	   <h3>Hello! I’m Ben Hunter - thank you for visiting my little corner of the web.</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>I’m a software developer who recently graduated with a B.Sc. in Computing Science and a Certificate in Computer Game Development from the University of Alberta. I love to make software, design and create things, play music, and do anything that allows me to be creative.</p>

	   <h3>Education</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>Although I really enjoy the tree of computing science and all of its branches, I didn’t always know it was for me. In fact, for the first two years of my undergraduate career, I was enrolled in the general science program with a biology major and a chemistry minor (I had been watching a lot of "House" and thought medicine might be for me). However, the classes I took were not indicative of a career in medicine; Latin, History, Psychology, Geology, Philosophy and other extraneous courses were among my general science course-load. In my second semester of second year I took CMPUT 101 on a whim, and absolutely loved it; it was the first class where I actually wanted to explore the material in my free time. While I didn’t know exactly what I wanted with a degree in computing, I felt it would be a good choice for my future. Fast forward three years and I have a broad skill set in the discipline including programming, agile development, networks, databases, web applications, video game development, 3D animation and graphics, algorithms, and more.</p>

	   <h3>Speaking of Video Games...</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>One of the most exciting applications of computing for me is video games. The possibility that something I imagine or dream about could be put into an interactive format to provoke emotion or enjoyment in another person, is something I just find so beautiful. I think I’m drawn to games because I think of them as the accumulation of many different skills, ideas, and experiences. I feel that matches my strengths as I’m interested in a lot of different things and prefer a broad skill set to a singular specialty.  As mentioned earlier, I graduated with a certificate in computer game development, which enabled me to take game-focused courses and allowed me the opportunity to create several games with teams during my degree. I’m still not sure what the future has in store for me, but I intend on ensuring games are in it, even if as a hobby.</p>

	   <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
	   <div class="well">
	     <p>I’m originally from beautiful Salt Spring Island, B.C. the land of infinite deer. When I’m not at a computer, you’ll find me shooting hoops, writing down bad jokes or puns, playing music, or cracking wise. I love fantasy, especially Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, and recently have developed a fascination with outer space and astronomy. My favourite thing in the world is learning new information that inspires me, makes me think about something in a different way, or makes me chuckle. If you have read thus far I commend you for your persistence, and thank you again for your interest.</p>
